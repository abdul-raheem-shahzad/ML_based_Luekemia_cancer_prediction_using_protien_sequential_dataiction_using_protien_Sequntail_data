# ML Based Luekemia Cancer Prediction Using Protien Sequential
In this project we are foucing weahter a person ifected from CML or not based on Protien Sequences
Data Preprocedding Techniques:
- Outlier Removal using Quantile method
- Putting mean in Null values
- Data Augmentation
### ML Agorithms Used:
- Random Forest
- Decison Tree
- Logisitc Regression
- XG boost
- KNN.
- SVM.
- The XG Boost Acheived an accuracy of 94.5%
